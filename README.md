## Portfolio Description

This project is to start a page that displays the skills and projects that I have and have completed in order to show my software engineering skills to the public and possible future employers. It also allows people who like what they see to contact me if they would like to either get to know me more or want my expertise on something.

## Wireframes

Here are the wireframes for the beginning thoughts of the site.

Once complete tally up the time and determine how long the project will take to complete. Now break those features into MVP and PostMVP so you can guarantee you will have a fully functioning project to demo. 

### MVP/PostMVP - 5min

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP (examples)

- Pull data using google json api
- Render data on page 
- Allow user to choose favorites 
- Save their choices in firebase

#### PostMVP 

- Anything else that is not MVP

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into smaller components.  Try and capture what logic would need to be defined if the game was broken down into the following categories.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the portfolio. Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the portfolio must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe.

#### MVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 
| Menu | H | 1hr | 0.5hr |
| Regular Nav | H | 1hr | 4hr |  
| content and grid display | M | 3hr | 3hr |
| Javascript interaction | H | 3hr |  4hr | 
| Social Media Icons | L | 1hr |  0hr |
| Total | H | 9.hrs | 11.5hrs |

#### PostMVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | 
| Hover changes | L | 3hr | -hr | hr |
| Better Fonts | L | 1hr | hr |
| Adding Form | H | 1.5hr|  hr | 
| Bootstrap | H | 4hr | hr |
| Multi-Page | L | 4hr | hr |
