                    <h3>About me</h3>
                    <p>Hi there! My name is Mitchell Bennett, but I mostly go by Mitch these days.
                       I'm a new software engineer who is raring to get his foot through the door.
                       When I'm not coding on the computer I like to head outdoors to play some
                       ultimate frisbee. If the outdoors aren't an option, then I'm a pretty good
                       bowler as well. I have expertis in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and SQL. Along with
                       my software engineering skills, I bring a positive can-do attitude as someone
                       who is willing to never give up on an issue and will always bring a smile to
                       the workplace.
                    </p>
